I am an Applied AI Research Scientist at [Writer](https://writer.com/) and Visiting Researcher in the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) group](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/research/themes/natural-language-processing) at the University of Cambridge.

My main research focus is automatic Grammatical Error Detection and Correction (GED/GEC), but I have also worked on codeswitching (using more than one language in a sentence), automatic annotation, artificial data generation, robust evaluation, and discourse parsing. I built and maintain the ERRor ANnotation Toolkit ([ERRANT](https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant)), which is widely used to measure progress in GEC, and also led the Building Educational Applications Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction ([BEA-2019](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/)).

I completed my PhD as a member of [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge where I was supervised by [Ted Briscoe](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ejb1/) and supported by the Institute for Automated Language Teaching and Assessment ([ALTA](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/)). Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant in the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the National University of Singapore under [Hwee Tou Ng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nght/). I completed a MSc in Speech and Language Processing and an undergraduate MA(Hons) in Chinese and Linguistics, both at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).
